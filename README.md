<h1>NEAT Neural Network for Flappy Bird Problem</h1>

<p>Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen. Nguyen created the game over the period of several days, using a bird protagonist that he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.<br>
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.<br>
